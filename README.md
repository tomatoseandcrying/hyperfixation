Chud Joker uses a custom context to detect probability hits: "context.chudhit" (go figure)
To use this properly, you'll need to include "G.GAME.chudhit = G.GAME.chudhit + 1" whenever you hit the probability check
You'll also need to reset it with "G.GAME.chudhit = 0" whenever the probability check misses
